  <h1>Demo</h1>

  <p>This is a live demo of PicoShare.</p>

  <p>
    This demo instance behaves a little differently than a real PicoShare
    server:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Uploads are limited to 10 MB</li>
    <li>Uploads expire after 5 minutes</li>
    <li>You can only download files uploaded from your IP address</li>
  </ul>

  <h1 class="title">What is PicoShare?</h1>

  <p>PicoShare is a service for sharing images, videos, and other files.</p>

  <p>
    On PicoShare, only <i>you</i> can upload files. You can share links to those
    files with anyone, and they never have to sign up for an account.
  </p>

  <p>PicoShare puts you fully in control, which means:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You can share direct download links without forcing your guests to see ads
      or prompts to sign up for an account.
    </li>
    <li>There are no restrictions on file type, size, or content.</li>
    <li>PicoShare never resizes or re-encodes your media files.</li>
    <li>
      PicoShare preserves the original filename and metadata for your files.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PicoShare is easy to self-host. See our
    <a href="https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare">source repo</a> for details.
